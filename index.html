        <h2>Description</h2>



<p>REDHAWK is a software-defined radio (SDR) framework designed to support the development,
deployment, and management of real-time software radio applications.
To support the design and development of software applications, REDHAWK provides tools that allow
development and testing of software modules called "Components" and composition of Components
into "Waveform Applications" that can be seamlessly deployed on a single computer or multiple
network-enabled computers. </p>

<p>The REDHAWK integrated development environment (IDE) provides tools to support development of REDHAWK software.  The development and deployment of REDHAWK Applications are aided by graphical editors and drag-and-drop Waveform construction. The IDE allows users to interact with and control multiple running REDHAWK
instances and applications.</p>

<h3>Recent Announcements</h3>

<p><strong>Release of REDHAWK 2.0.6 (July 2017)</strong> - Download the new Core Framework, IDE, and documentation from our <a href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/redhawk/releases/tag/2.0.6">Downloads</a> page. The effort in REDHAWK 2.0.6 focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li> Initial FOSS Release of REDHAWK Enterprise Integration Assets, which provide the ability to interact with REDHAWK in a JRE environment. The REDHAWK Enterprise Integration Assets include:
  <ul>
    <li> REDHAWK Driver: Provides simplified access to REDHAWK via standard Java interfaces. This Asset shields all interaction with the underlying REDHAWK Components and provides a simplified API for Java developers interacting with a REDHAWK Domain. The REDHAWK Driver can be leveraged as a standalone Java Archive (JAR) file.
    <li> REDHAWK OSGi Connector: Implements OSGi's Managed Service Factory interface to allow users to register pre-configured instances of REDHAWK connections into a Karaf container.
    <li> REDHAWK REST: Provides a REST Service to command and control a REDHAWK instance.
    <li> REDHAWK WebSocket: Provides an HTML5-compliant WebSocket implementation that enables the ability to stream data from any REDHAWK BulkIO-enabled Port or Event Channel.
    <li> Camel REDHAWK: Provides a Camel Component for interacting with a REDHAWK Domain. This Component can be connected with other Apache Camel Components as a data flow solution.
  </ul>
<li> Providing diagnostic messages for log4py configuration files that contain errors and adding support to allow line continuation characters in the log configuration files.
<li> Improving the IDE's Domain refresh logic to prevent the IDE from consuming excessive numbers of threads in some scenarios.
<li> Documenting a publisher/subscriber pattern when accessing an EventChannel from the Domain.
<li> Modifying Burst IO implementation so that BurstIO output Ports will only override the BurstSRI mode flag in pushBurst if given std::complex sample data.
<li> Ensuring the creation of and appropriate permissions are on the services directory in SDRROOT.
<li> Fixing code generators for Port generation of C++ Components to correctly handle data structures returned from methods.
<li> Resolving issue when activating local servants for MessageConsumerPort and MessageSupplierPort Java classes.
<li> Resolving issue when ossie.utils.log4py.config is imported after ossie.utils.sb. Fixed by CCB-263 (Formatting issues in -logcfgfile causes python devices to crash) and added unit test to address issue when ossie.utils.log4py.config is imported after ossie.utils.sb.
<li> Improving documentation of Signal Related Information (SRI).
<li> Supporting the default version of Octave available in CentOS 7 (3.8.2).
<li> Correcting the parsing of some numeric literals in Octave M files.
<li> Resolving issue with the GPP seg faulting when a Component's soft package dependency does not have proper file access privileges.
<li> Resolving issue with getStreamDefinition returning a pointer to memory that could be reclaimed during processing;  which would invalidate any access through that pointer.  The caller now receives a pointer to a copy of a Stream Definition.
<li> Correctly computing deployment-specific capacities that manage hardware resource requirements in cases where the Component is part of a host collocation deployment.
<li> Updating Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
<li> Revising BulkIO High-speed data code example in User Manual.
<li> Updating the Python package to create instances of the same Application for multiple processes or threads without conflicts.
<li> Updating the Python Sandbox to make and break connections from multiple threads without conflicts.
<li> Addressing numerous bug fixes.
</ul>

<p><strong>Release of REDHAWK 2.1.0 (April 2017)</strong> - Download the new Core Framework, IDE, and documentation from our <a href="download.html">Downloads</a> page. The effort in REDHAWK 2.1.0 focused on:
<ul>

<li>Adding support for Components to be deployed on a specific GPP, and conversely allowing the GPP to restrict deployments through a matching set of id/value pairs. These id/value pairs are defined in the Software Assembly Descriptor and Device Configuration Definition files respectively. Users may refer to this feature as the "special snowflake" deployment Property.
<li>Shared address space Components: Significant enhancement of Component model and BULKIO to support high performance I/O. Preliminary developer documentation for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 Beta Release is available at <a href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address</a>. This feature will be under extensive evaluation during the 2.1.x beta release series and is expected to provide the ground work for several new major enhancements to REDHAWK.
<li>Adding support for a new type of Property, "utctime", extending the list that includes types such as "short" or "string". This timestamp Property is used in Property change events and can be queried from Components/Devices with the id QUERY_TIMESTAMP, which is useful when synchronizing the state of the system. The new type of Property can be used by Component/Device developers as an additional type of Property.
<li>Adding cacheDirectory and workingDirectory Properties to the GPP. These properties provide the deployer with control over where Components are stored (cacheDirectory) and the directory from which Components are executed (workingDirectory).
<li>Redesigning the IDE's Event Viewer to improve the ability to monitor event channels.
<li>Ending support of Command-line interactive mode (-i) on Components, Services, and Devices. Terminal prompt interactions should be through the Python Sandbox.
<li>Improving Python tooling to help manage REDHAWK systems. For example, these improvements include eventChannelManager, allocationManager, and connectionManager helpers as well as simpler event monitoring.
<li>Adding functionality to allow Components that have a usesdevice dependency to now be launched on the same host (i.e., Device Manager/Node) as the Device satisfying the usesdevice requirement. This functionality is provided through an extension of the componentplacement hostcollocation.
<li>Improving recovery of a REDHAWK Domain after a catastrophic failure. The Device Manager reboots all associated Devices/Services when it detects a reset Domain Manager after a catastrophic failure in the Domain Manager. This reboot only happens if (1) persistence is enabled and (2) the name service log, event service log, and persistence database are emptied.
<li>Adding new concurrent logging appender for C++ Components to improve readability of logging messages when multiple processes are writing to the same log file.
<li>Improving the New Project Wizard to warn users if the project location selected already contains files that will become part of the project. Increase user awareness of files that may be moved, deleted, or packaged with a project.
<li>Updating the IDE to use the latest available Eclipse tooling, Eclipse Neon. For more information about Eclipse Neon, refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/neon/noteworthy">http://www.eclipse.org/neon/noteworthy</a>.
<li>Documenting a publisher/subscriber pattern when accessing an EventChannel from the Domain.
<li>Documenting available affinity processing directives when deploying Devices, Services, and Components.
<li>Adding support for the REDHAWK Core Framework, IDE, assets, and new REDHAWK projects to now compile against and run on Java 8.
<li>Extending DeviceManager to call configure() on Services at the time they register. This enables users to implement custom Property handling if so desired.
<li>Resolving issue when activating local servants for MessageConsumerPort and MessageSupplierPort Java classes.
<li>Improving Python Sandbox tooling for new Domain features and resources. Specifically, extended DataSource to provide access to all the available SRI and the data timestamp.
<li>Adding reservation schema graph in the documentation to enhance the text describing capacity allocation reservation for the GPP.
<li>Improving documentation of Signal Related Information (SRI).
<li>Updating Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
<li>Addressing numerous bug fixes.
</ul>

<li>Addressing numerous Discrepancy Reports (DRs).
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/redhawk/releases/2.0.0">Final Release of REDHAWK 2.0</a> (December 10, 2015)</strong> - The effort in REDHAWK 2.0 focused on improving system management, establishing a core set of REDHAWK assets, and enhancing the IDE user experience.  This effort included:
<ul>
<li>improving processing performance</li>
<li>promoting consistency among core assets</li>
<li>improving and focusing on a comprehensive set of core assets, including the addition of Waveforms</li>
<li>providing an improved user experience by re-implementing IDE diagrams for Waveforms and Nodes</li>
<li>adding IDE support for REDHAWK shared library projects</li>
<li>adding IDE support for differentiating projects with namespaces</li>
</ul>

<p>Within the Core Framework, system scalability was addressed by creating or expanding system managers (connections, allocations, and events), improving the dependency management structure for Components, and by further automating the process of distributing processing tasks. Processing performance improvements focused on NUMA balancing related to both processing and data ingest/egress. Finally, the burden on the component developer was reduced by making it easier to access  system resources, simplifying properties, shifting BulkIO data management from packet-based to stream-based, and simplifying the structure of generated code.</p>

<p>In the IDE, diagrams were re-implemented to provide a refreshed look and a simplified, more slimlined display of diagram elements. New visualizations were added to help developers more quickly and easily create Waveforms and Nodes and monitor and debug them more easily at runtime. Shared library support was improved to enable developers to better share code between Components and Devices, while creating software that follows REDHAWK standards for easy reuse and deployment in REDHAWK systems. Namespaces were added to assist with upgrades, allowing multiple versions of a Component to be installed on the same system. Additionally, namespaces enable developers to more clearly differentiate development efforts like forked projects or contributions by different organizations.</p>

<p>For the REDHAWK assets, consistency was achieved by using common Port types for similar types of data and renaming Ports to establish a consistent naming convention. The set of assets was expanded to include two new assets for file I/O, a Component for decoding FM RBDS, a Component for PSK demodulation, an FEI Device simulator for generating FM RDS streams from audio files, and a set of Waveforms that collectively demonstrate the use of each Component. The set of assets was focused by removing deprecated Components (whitenoise, DataReader, DataWriter, freqfilter, medianfilter, unwrap, and BurstDeserializer). Core assets were used as examples of how to exercise new REDHAWK features. For example, domain awareness was leveraged by FileReader and FileWriter, the new BulkIO stream API was utilized by psd, sequences within struct properties were added to sinksocket, the updated shared library support was used to re-implement each shared library, and each asset was moved into the "rh" namespace.</p>
