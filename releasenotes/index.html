                <h2>Description</h2>



                <p>REDHAWK is a software-defined radio (SDR) framework designed to support the development,
                deployment, and management of real-time software radio applications.
                To support the design and development of software applications, REDHAWK provides tools that allow
                development and testing of software modules called "Components" and composition of Components
                into "Waveform Applications" that can be seamlessly deployed on a single computer or multiple
                network-enabled computers. </p>

                <p>The REDHAWK integrated development environment (IDE) provides tools to support development of REDHAWK software.  The development and deployment of REDHAWK Applications are aided by graphical editors and drag-and-drop Waveform construction. The IDE allows users to interact with and control multiple running REDHAWK
                instances and applications.</p>

                <h3>Recent Announcements</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/redhawksdr/redhawk/releases/tag/2.1.1">Release of REDHAWK 2.1.1</a> (August 2017)</strong> - Download the new Core Framework, IDE, and documentation from our <a href="download.html">Downloads</a> page. The effort in REDHAWK 2.1.1 focused on:
<p><strong>Core REDHAWK Features and APIs</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Shared address space Components: Significant enhancement of Component model and BULKIO to support high performance I/O. Preliminary developer documentation for the REDHAWK 2.1.1 Beta Release is available at <a href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address</a>. This feature will be under extensive evaluation during the 2.1.x beta release series and is expected to provide the ground work for several new major enhancements to REDHAWK.
                    <li> Adding the API for a new type of tuner, a scanning Device.
                    <li> Adding support for a new type of Property, utctime, extending the list that includes types such as short or string. This timestamp Property is used in Property change events and can be queried from Components/Devices with the id QUERY_TIMESTAMP, which is useful when synchronizing the state of the system. The new type of Property can be used by Component/Device developers as an additional type of Property.
                    <li> Adding functionality for capacity to be reserved for an entire host collocation on the SAD file. The reservation is a capacity floor for the Components in the host collocation, where the amount of capacity utilized by the aggregate set of Components is this reservation or actual, whichever is higher. This reservation is allocated against the target GPP running this Application, allowing the GPP to verify that the request can be satisfied, reducing the likelihood of over-subscription.
                    <li> Adding functionality to allow Components that have a usesdevice dependency to now be launched on the same host (Device Manager/Node) as the Device satisfying the usesdevice requirement. This functionality is provided through an extension of the componentplacement hostcollocation.
                    <li> Extending DeviceManager to call configure() on Services at the time they register. This enables users to implement custom Property handling if so desired. 
                </ul>
<p><strong>REDHAWK Systems</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Changing the default logging directory for omniEvents service to reside in /var/log/omniEvents. 
                    <li> Improving nodeBooter so it does not deploy if --user or --group are set while --daemon is not, and if the command-line arguments to nodeBooter are malformed, deployment fails.
                    <li> Adding support for the state of the Connection Manager and Event Channel Manager to be restored when persistence is enabled.
                </ul>
<p><strong>Project Code Generation</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Fixing code generators for Port generation of C++ Components to correctly handle data structures returned from methods.
                    <li> Providing functionality to add custom headers to project files when generating code. 
                    <li> Providing Generate Waveform and Generate Node buttons in the IDE editors to initiate file generation. This ensures that Waveform and Node project spec files are created or modified only when requested by the user. 
                </ul>
<p><strong>Python Tooling and Sandbox</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Adding snapshot capability of network data and performing SDDS packet analysis on the captured data. 
                    <li> Improving Python tooling to help manage REDHAWK systems. For example, these improvements include eventChannelManager, allocationManager, and connectionManager helpers as well as simpler event monitoring.
                    <li> Improving Python Sandbox tooling for new Domain features and resources. Specifically, extended DataSource to provide access to all the available SRI and the data timestamp.
                    <li> Adding an option to enable the Domain Manager's logging level to be dynamically changed.
                    <li> Correcting issue in the Python Sandbox so now when the BulkIO queue is full, the Python Sandbox no longer locks up when trying to release stopped Components.
                </ul>
<p><strong>GPP</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Improving flexibility to ignore GPP threshold checks when determining if the GPP should go into a BUSY state.
                </ul>
<p><strong>IDE</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Updating the IDE to use the latest available Eclipse tooling, Eclipse Oxygen.
                    <li> Providing a "TM Terminal" in the IDE, a full-featured terminal emulator that provides full ANSI cursor control, readline, and coloring. 
                    <li> Adding the Components tab to the Waveform editor in the IDE to allow editing of Component instantiation details, including logging configuration. This information will be used to resolve the LOGGING_CONFIG_URI parameter during Component deployment.
                    <li> Showing IDL details when Ports are selected in the REDHAWK Explorer view.
                    <li> Providing validation of Property references in SAD and DCD files and flagging invalid Property references as errors. 
                    <li> Adding the ability to terminate services in the Sandbox via the hover pad or the delete key and making the terminate icon more distinct throughout the IDE.
                    <li> Providing an option in the IDE to perform a FrontEnd Device allocation in the background to aid developers who are debugging their FrontEnd Devices.
                    <li> Improving the IDE's Domain refresh logic to prevent the IDE from consuming excessive numbers of threads in some scenarios.
                    <li> Correcting the parsing of some numeric literals in Octave M files. 
                    <li> Fixing links in the IDE's help contents so REDHAWK help now displays correctly when links within the help are selected.
                </ul>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li> Adding documentation for developing a logging configuration plug-in that will be used to resolve LOGGING_CONFIG_URI parameter during deployment of Devices, Services and Components.
                    <li> Renaming the Generating Code section to Generating Code for Components and explaining the code generation process and what occurs in the IDE when the code is generated.
                    <li> Revising the BulkIO High-speed data code example in User Manual.
                </ul>

                <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/redhawksdr/redhawk/releases/tag/2.1.0">Release of REDHAWK 2.1.0</a> (April 2017)</strong> - The effort in REDHAWK 2.1.0 focused on:
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding support for Components to be deployed on a specific GPP, and conversely allowing the GPP to restrict deployments through a matching set of id/value pairs. These id/value pairs are defined in the Software Assembly Descriptor and Device Configuration Definition files respectively. Users may refer to this feature as the "special snowflake" deployment Property.
                    <li>Shared address space Components: Significant enhancement of Component model and BULKIO to support high performance I/O. Preliminary developer documentation for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 Beta Release is available at <a href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address</a>.

This timestamp Property is used in Property change events and can be queried from Components/Devices with the id QUERY_TIMESTAMP, which is useful when synchronizing the state of the system. The new type of Property can be used by Component/Device developers as an additional type of Property.
                    <li>Adding cacheDirectory and workingDirectory Properties to the GPP. These properties provide the deployer with control over where Components are stored (cacheDirectory) and the directory from which Components are executed (workingDirectory).
                    <li>Redesigning the IDE's Event Viewer to improve the ability to monitor event channels.
                    <li>Ending support of Command-line interactive mode (-i) on Components, Services, and Devices. Terminal prompt interactions should be through the Python Sandbox.
                    <li>Improving Python tooling to help manage REDHAWK systems. For example, these improvements include eventChannelManager, allocationManager, and connectionManager helpers as well as simpler event monitoring.
                    <li>Adding functionality to allow Components that have a usesdevice dependency to now be launched on the same host (i.e., Device Manager/Node) as the Device satisfying the usesdevice requirement. This functionality is provided through an extension of the componentplacement hostcollocation.
                    <li>Improving recovery of a REDHAWK Domain after a catastrophic failure. The Device Manager reboots all associated Devices/Services when it detects a reset Domain Manager after a catastrophic failure in the Domain Manager. This reboot only happens if (1) persistence is enabled and (2) the name service log, event service log, and persistence database are emptied.
                    <li>Adding new concurrent logging appender for C++ Components to improve readability of logging messages when multiple processes are writing to the same log file.
                    <li>Improving the New Project Wizard to warn users if the project location selected already contains files that will become part of the project. Increase user awareness of files that may be moved, deleted, or packaged with a project.
                    <li>Updating the IDE to use the latest available Eclipse tooling, Eclipse Neon. For more information about Eclipse Neon, refer to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/neon/noteworthy">http://www.eclipse.org/neon/noteworthy</a>.
                    <li>Documenting a publisher/subscriber pattern when accessing an EventChannel from the Domain.
                    <li>Documenting available affinity processing directives when deploying Devices, Services, and Components.
                    <li>Adding support for the REDHAWK Core Framework, IDE, assets, and new REDHAWK projects to now compile against and run on Java 8.
                    <li>Extending DeviceManager to call configure() on Services at the time they register. This enables users to implement custom Property handling if so desired.
                    <li>Resolving issue when activating local servants for MessageConsumerPort and MessageSupplierPort Java classes.
                    <li>Improving Python Sandbox tooling for new Domain features and resources. Specifically, extended DataSource to provide access to all the available SRI and the data timestamp.
                    <li>Adding reservation schema graph in the documentation to enhance the text describing capacity allocation reservation for the GPP.
                    <li>Improving documentation of Signal Related Information (SRI).
                    <li>Updating Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
                    <li>Addressing numerous bug fixes.
                </ul>
