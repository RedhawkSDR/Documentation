      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">Core REDHAWK Features and APIs</span>
           <ul class="itemize2">
           <li class="itemize">Shared address space Components: Significant enhancement of Component
           model and BulkIO to support high performance I/O. Preliminary developer documentation
           for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 beta release is available at <a 
href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1.2/docs/shared-" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1.2/docs/shared-</span></a>
           <br 
class="newline" /><a 
href="address" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">address</span></a>. This feature will be under extensive evaluation during the 2.1.x beta
           release series and is expected to provide the ground work for several new major
           enhancements to REDHAWK.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Implementing a new zero-copy IPC mechanism for BulkIO that uses shared
           memory  to  transfer  data  between  two  processes  on  the  same  host.  This  is
           a follow-on enhancement to the shared address space Components feature.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
           Preliminary developer documentation for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 beta release is
           available at <a 
href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1.2/docs/shared-memory" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1.2/docs/shared-memory</span></a>.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">FrontEnd Interfaces (FEI) Property definition change: For Devices, the <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ectt-1200">FRONTEND::tuner_allocation  FRONTEND::listener_allocation  </span>allocation
           properties are now writeonly instead of readwrite. Because the properties are
           now  created  as  writeonly,  they  can  no  longer  be  queried.  This  change  was
           made to prevent confusion with the actual state of the FrontEnd Device, which
           is reported by the <span 
class="ectt-1200">FRONTEND::tuner status </span>property. Existing Core Asset FEI
           Devices have been updated with this change. New FrontEnd Devices created
           with the IDE will automatically have this change.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding  support  for  a  new  type  of  Property,  utctime,  extending  the  list  that
           includes  types  such  as  short  or  string.  This  timestamp  Property  is  used  in
           PropertyChangeEvents  and  can  be  queried  from  Components/Devices  with
           the id <span 
class="ectt-1200">QUERY_TIMESTAMP</span>, which is useful when synchronizing the state of the
           system. utctime can be used by Component/Device developers as an additional
           type of Property.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding functionality for capacity to be reserved for an entire host collocation
           on the SAD file. The reservation is a capacity floor for the Components in the
           host collocation, where the amount of capacity utilized by the aggregate set of
           Components is this reservation or actual, whichever is higher. This reservation
           is  allocated  against  the  target  GPP  running  this  Application,  allowing  the
           GPP  to  verify  that  the  request  can  be  satisfied,  reducing  the  likelihood  of
           over-subscription.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding  support  for  DCD  files  to  have  a  startorder  attribute,  which  functions
           similarly to the SAD file&#8217;s startorder. On startup, "start" is automatically called
           on  Devices  and  Services  (when  possible),  and  on  shutdown,  reverse-order
           "stop" is called. The IDE&#8217;s tooling for DCD files has been updated to display
           and edit startorder.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding support for the DeviceManager to resolve run time environment settings
           when deploying Devices and Services that have soft package dependencies.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving  issue  so  that  during  Application  release,  calls  to  the  Application
           object no longer result in misleading errors.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding functionality within the code generators so they create C++, Java, or
           Python constants for enumerated values defined in the PRF.
           </li>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
           <li class="itemize">Improving flexibility to ignore GPP threshold checks when determining if the
           GPP should go into a BUSY state.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Removing  some  obsolete  options  from  the  Core  Framework  and  BulkIO
           configure scripts.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving issue where processes with spaces in the names would cause the
           GPP to terminate.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving  issue  to  allow  for  slow  startup  conditions  of  OmniNames  service
           before starting OmniEvents service.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding  the  stop  timeout  control  to  the  Application.  Options,  like  the  stop
           timeout, can be configured when designing Waveforms in the IDE.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving issue with incorrect exception being thrown during allocateCapacity.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving issue when shutting down orb from Python resources.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Providing a warning in the logs if a message is too large.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving issue with the code generators so they can be run on systems with
           FIPS enabled.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving  issue  so  generated  C++  FEI  Devices  do  not  leak  memory  when
           deallocating listeners. Existing Devices must be regenerated and recompiled
           to apply this fix.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving a memory leak in FrontendTunerDevice::create(). Existing Devices
           must be recompiled to apply this fix.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Resolving issue so the function <span

           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adjusting the default tuner type for the Python Sandbox tuner allocation. It is
           now <span

           FEI Device.

 id="x1-2000"></a>New Features</h3>
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >The following IDE and Core Framework new features were added in REDHAWK 2.1.2.
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The Python Sandbox DataSink object supports a stream API, allowing the DataSink
      to handle multiple incoming streams and variable SRI.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The startorder attribute was added to the componentinstantiation element of DCD
      (node)  files.  When  startorder  is  set,  the  Device  or  Service  (if  it  supports  the
      CF::Resource interface), will receive a start call on the Device Manager startup and
      a stop call on the Device Manager shutdown.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Adding functionality in the Sandbox so when using "connect" on a REDHAWK object
      in a Python session, if the object is an FEI Device and it has a tuner allocated, a
      listener is automatically created and connected to that tuner.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  "metrics"  function  on  the  Application  object  accepts  two  string  sequences
      (components and attributes), and returns the current utilization by all Components
      of GPP resources. An aggregate consumption amount is also returned.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      </li>

      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added the ability to add well-known REDHAWK Properties when editing Properties.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added the ability to connect to a Domain Manager by selecting from a list.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added startorder support to the DCD diagram editor.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Adding   editor   support   to   adjust   GPP   reservations   for   hostcollocations   in   a
      Waveform.

      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added the ability to view Waveform metrics in the Properties view.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added options to the SAD XML model.
      </li>
