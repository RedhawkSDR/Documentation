<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >The effort in REDHAWK 2.1.1 focused on:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">Core REDHAWK Features and APIs</span>
           <ul class="itemize2">
           <li class="itemize">Shared address space Components: Significant enhancement of Component
           model and BulkIO to support high performance I/O. Preliminary developer documentation
           for the REDHAWK 2.1.0 beta release is available at <a 
href="https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">https://github.com/RedhawkSDR/core-framework/tree/develop-2.1/docs/shared-address</span></a>.
           <br 
class="newline" />This feature will be under extensive evaluation during the 2.1.x beta release
           series and is expected to provide the ground work for several new major enhancements
           to REDHAWK.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding the API for a new type of tuner, a scanning Device.
           </li>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
           <li class="itemize">Adding  support  for  a  new  type  of  Property,  utctime,  extending  the  list  that
           includes  types  such  as  short  or  string.  This  timestamp  Property  is  used  in
           Property change events and can be queried from Components/Devices with
           the id <br 
class="newline" />QUERY_TIMESTAMP,  which  is  useful  when  synchronizing  the  state  of  the
           system.  The  new  type  of  Property  can  be  used  by  Component/Device
           developers as an additional type of Property.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding functionality for capacity to be reserved for an entire host collocation
           on the SAD file. The reservation is a capacity floor for the Components in the
           host collocation, where the amount of capacity utilized by the aggregate set of
           Components is this reservation or actual, whichever is higher. This reservation
           is  allocated  against  the  target  GPP  running  this  Application,  allowing  the
           GPP  to  verify  that  the  request  can  be  satisfied,  reducing  the  likelihood  of
           over-subscription.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding functionality to allow Components that have a usesdevice dependency
           to now be launched on the same host (Device Manager/Node) as the Device
           satisfying the usesdevice requirement. This functionality is provided through an
           extension of the componentplacement hostcollocation.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Extending  DeviceManager  to  call  configure()  on  Services  at  the  time  they
           register.  This  enables  users  to  implement  custom  Property  handling  if  so
           desired.</li></ul>

      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="phvb8t-x-x-120">REDHAWK Systems</span>
           <ul class="itemize2">
           <li class="itemize">Changing  the  default  logging  directory  for  omniEvents  service  to  reside  in
           /var/log/omniEvents.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Improving nodeBooter so it does not deploy if &#8211;user or &#8211;group are set while
           &#8211;daemon  is  not,  and  if  the  command-line  arguments  to  nodeBooter  are
           malformed, deployment fails.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding support for the state of the Connection Manager and Event Channel
           Manager to be restored when persistence is enabled.</li></ul>

           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Providing functionality to add custom headers to project files when generating
           code.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Providing Generate Waveform and Generate Node buttons in the IDE editors
           to initiate file generation. This ensures that Waveform and Node project spec
           files are created or modified only when requested by the user.</li></ul>

class="phvb8t-x-x-120">Python Tooling and Sandbox</span>
           <ul class="itemize2">
           <li class="itemize">Adding  snapshot  capability  of  network  data  and  performing  SDDS  packet
           analysis on the captured data.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Improving Python tooling to help manage REDHAWK systems. For example,
           these  improvements  include  eventChannelManager,  allocationManager,  and
           connectionManager helpers as well as simpler event monitoring.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Improving  Python  Sandbox  tooling  for  new  Domain  features  and  resources.
           Specifically, extended DataSource to provide access to all the available SRI
           and the data timestamp.
           </li>
           <li class="itemize">Adding  an  option  to  enable  the  Domain  Manager&#8217;s  logging  level  to  be

 id="x1-7000"></a>Core Framework Fixes</h4>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">RH::DEPLOYMENT_ROOT for deployed Components is the cache directory, not the
      working directory.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Generated  code  for  FEI  Python  Devices  produces  a  properly-formed  exception
      when the sample rate, center frequency, or bandwidth requested on the digital tuner
      control Port is less than 0.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added  the  function  addChannels  to  the  FEI  base  classes.  This  function  enables
      the developer to add combinations of tuner types in the same Device. The function
      setNumChannels  is  still  supported,  but  its  functionality  has  been  replaced  by
      addChannels.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Device Manager nodeBooter process no longer prints an error to stdout when a
      Service is included in the Node.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">GPP  returns  the  current  cacheDirectory  and  workingDirectory,  even  when  not
      overridden on the DCD.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Most typical shared library Components can be unloaded and relaunched without
      error. If a library is in use and has been modified, an exception is thrown when trying
      to create new Components using the library.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The function set_rf_flow_id in the Python FEI code generators no longer uses a
      reserved word as an argument to the function.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">The  Port  name  is  now  used  as  the  default  name  for  adding  entries  into  the
      connection descriptor table.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Corrected test that erroneously failed when Java is disabled.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When a numerical property is initialized in either the SAD file or the DCD file, if the
      value contains illegal characters (for example: a, b, x), then the deployment fails.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">In the Sandbox, connecting a DataSink to an SDDS output Port now will return with
      a no matching Port exception.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">On CentOS 7, C++ LoadableDevices no longer throw a CORBA::COMM_FAILURE
      exception from load() when the file cannot be loaded.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added    support    to    Python    parsers    for    new    elements:    devicerequires,
      deployerrequires and usesdeviceref.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Added support to allow LOGGING_CONFIG_URI to be passed on the command
      line  during  Component  deployment  irrespective  of  whether  it  was  defined  by  the
      Component.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">When the BulkIO queue is full, the Python Sandbox no longer locks up when trying
      to release stopped Components.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Thread  management  in  the  Python  Component/Device  base  class  is  updated  to
      better utilize the processor.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Extended  kickDomain  API  to  include  the  ability  to  change  the  logging  level  for
      Domain and Device Manager processes.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Changed runser for omniEvents to omniORB user.
      </li></ul>
